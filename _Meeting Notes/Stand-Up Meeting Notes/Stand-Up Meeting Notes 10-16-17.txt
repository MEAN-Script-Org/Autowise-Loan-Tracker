Done:
	- Steven & Harrison : UI/Layout Components for Admin 
	- Max : CRUD Functionality, Schema for Users and Loans.
	- Michael : Manual testing and collaboration with Max's schema set up. Schema for Users and Loans.
	- Marcial : Created cleaner, simpler MEAN Repo. Implemented email functionality. Talked to client and modularized requirements.

TODO:
	- Team: Set-up definitive roles, get someone to take charge of Unit-Testing.
	- Steven & Harrison : UI/Layout Components for User (relatively similar); Connect to work with MEAN Stack, this might mean transition with AngularUI
