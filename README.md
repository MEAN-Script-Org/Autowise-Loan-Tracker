# TODOs for successful client transition
  + Sign up for [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/)
  + Become a collaborator to our current project (need email)
  + Transfer project ownership
  + Know how to modify/remove Heroku variables
    + [Instructions](#soon)
  + Get email variables for automated emailing 
    + [Instructions](#soon)
  + Link inventory website to https://autowise.herokuapp.com
  + All of this will cost you:
    + $0/month **_for now_**, until database capacity is reached (512MB)
    + Prices of current database provider (mLab) then start at $15/month/GB
  + Enjoy your paperless loan tracking application

## Technical Recommendations
- Scaling: Instructions to move to a bigger database of the current provider can be found [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab#changing-plans)
  - Recommendation: Have archived loans as a static JSON/mongodump file in a S3 bucket or similar storage/CDN service. Only retrieve them when searching for them, and modify that file as such. 
  - Implementation: Change 'archived_filter' on *custom-filters.js*, reset loading for this, add a new Factory â†” Express interaction, add/remove loans to active MongoDB on loan 'revival' or death. Done.
    - *Learning opportunity* if no prior experience with these services

## Summary
<!-- high level feature/user-stories summary -->
This application is intended as the paperless replacement for loan applications for Autowise, an used-card dealership in Tallahassee, Florida. It also provides Autowise's customers the ability to track their application details, so they can login online whenever they want, and check their application and comments (updates, requests for more information) instead of flooding the phone lines.

Autowise customers (further referred to as 'customers') are able to:
- Create an account
- View their loan application status and their loan's buyer's order details
- See any comments they wrote, along with any system and non-admin comments.
<!-- If I get to it -->
<!-- - Change their password once account is created -->

Autowise employees ('admins') are also be able to: 
- Change loans status (even archive them)
- Find and update loans and warranty information
- Make and remove their own comments

Autowise managers ('super admins'), in addition to admins privileges, have the ability to:
- Remove any comments (expect for system's)
- Remove Loans
- Assign and revoke 'customer', 'admin', and 'super admin' privileges to any created user account.

<!-- Anything else? -->

## App Functionality

### Loan Management
#### Creating Loans
A Loan is created from a Buyer's Order. Loans are created from the **admin view** using the circular "+" button on the lower right corner of the page. Clicking this button opens the Buyer's Order modal (see [Buyer's Order](#buyers-order) for more information).

Upon creating a Loan, a User it's automatically assigned to it if the User already exists in the database. If a User has a matching full name (*case sensitive*) and DOB, as described by the purchaser on the Buyer's Order, the Loan will be attached to this User and it will appear on their account. If there is no User with this matching information, the loan will be *dangling* and not assigned to any User. However, if a customer creates an account with matching information later on, the Loan will be assigned to it (see [User Management](#user-management) for more information).
> The Loan-User match does **not** take the customer's driver's license number into consideration, although this may easily be implemented in *loans.crud.js*.


#### Buyer's Order
Modal that once completed, creates a loan in the system.

![Buyer's_Order](documentation/images/Buyer's_Order_modal.png)
> Screenshot of a Buyer's Order that is already filled out for a customer. A Co-Purchaser may be added at the bottom if necessary.

#### Modifying Loans

![Loan_Admin](documentation/images/Expanded_Loan_Accordion_Admin.png)
> Screenshot of a customers loan expanded from the accordion. Inside of this accordion tab you are able to change the status of the loan, edit the Buyer's order, change the warranty, and email the customer. Also comments may be left for the customer if needed.

All Loans in the database can be accessed from the **admin view**. When a loan is expanded, you have the option to edit the original Buyer's Order with the _Buyer's Order_ button underneath the Loan header. This brings up the Buyer's Order popup again. Any *submitted* changes made here are saved as modifications to the current Loan.
<!-- make this into an anchor, since it will be quoted A LOT  -->
> Updates to the purchaser/copurchaser's name or DOB will **not** result on automatic updates to possible users. This only happens loan or account CREATION. Modifying this will need some routing work (easy-medium difficulty).

A Loan's status may be changed with the _Change Status_ button under the Loan header. A popup appears that prompts you to select one of the 7 Loan statuses which are as follows:
- Received
- Submitted
- Pending
- Verified
- Approved
- Denied
- Archived

Confirming this popup updates the Loan to the selected status

![Loan_Status](documentation/images/Change_Status_Modal.png)
> Screenshot of the "Change Status" button. This will allow you to change the customers loan status to any option in the drop down menu. The status will update once you press the update button.

When a customer is logged in, they are presented with the **customer view**. A customer cannot create, modify, or delete any loans and may only see loans associated with their account. A customer may publish comments, as discussed in the following section.

![Loan_Customer](documentation/images/Expanded_Loan_Accordion_Customer.png)
> Screenshot of the customer view when they log in. It will show their loan status, their warranty plan if they have one, as well as the comments.

#### Comments on Loans
Comments are added on loans using the comment bar near the bottom of an expanded loan. Comments appear top to down within the body of the loan with newer comments appearing above older ones. Both customers and admins can create and see normal comments. As an admin user, you have the option of posting a comment as _admin-only_ which can only be viewed by admins.

Comments may only be deleted by the original poster (even admins cannot delete other admins' comments). Super admins, however, may delete comments from any user.

![Loan_Comments](documentation/images/Loan_Comments.png)
> Screenshot of what comments look like on a loan. Admins can leave comments that are visible to the customer or not visible to the customer.

#### Warranties - Admin
A warranty plan may also be added to a Loan with the _Change Warranty_ button. A popup appears with input fields for a warranty plan type, duration, mileage, and cost. Confirming this popup updates the Loan with a warranty plan, or updates the existing plan if there was already one.

![Admin_Warranty](documentation/images/Update_warranty_plan_modal.png)
> Screenshot of the "update warranty" modal. In this modal admins can change the information on the warranty that the customer has.

#### Mass Loan Operations
Each Loan header has a checkbox to the left. Click this box to select or unselect the Loan.

If a Loan is selected, when you hover over the circular "+" button in the lower right corner of the **admin view**, several additional buttons are revealed.
- The *pencil* button opens the change status popup as discussed in the Modifying Loans section. Confirming this popup will change all selected Loans to the status specified in the dropdown.
- The *box* button archives all selected Loans.
- The *trash* button (only visible to a _Super Admin_) deletes all selected Loans permanently.

#### Warranties - Customer
A customer may request a warranty plan on a specific loan by clicking the _Request a warranty plan_ button near the top of the loan. This takes the customer to the **customer loan view**. In this area, the customer searches for a warranty plan of interest based on criteria of plan type and car age and make. Available warranty plans are automatically filtered below and a customer selects one they are interested in. Upon selecting, a popup appears listing the warranty plan details and a confirmation button. When the button is clicked, an email with the warranty plan details is sent to Autowise and a comment is added to the loan with the requested plan information.

Once an admin reviews the plan, they may approve it by added a warranty plan to the specified loan, as described in the [Warranties-Admin](#warranties---admin) section

### User Management

#### User Creation and Types
Users are created by _registering_ on the login page. To create an account, a person must specify their name, a username, their DOB, and DL number (email is optional). To access your account, you log in on the **login page** with your specified username and password. The app does not have the ability to recover passwords, so _do not forget your password!_

![Login](documentation/images/Login_view.png)
> Screenshot of the login page. You must enter a valid username and password in order to log in.

![Register](documentation/images/Register_view.png)
> Screenshot of the Registration page. You must enter something valid for all of the required fields in order to register.

Upon registering, a User is assigned the role of a _customer_ who may view their loans and request warranty plans. When logged in as an _admin_, you may see all the loans in the database and make modifications to them. When logged in as a _super admin_, you have all of the privileges of admins in addition to the ability to delete loans, delete any comments, and change permissions of other users.

#### User Permissions and Account Management
To change permissions, access the *user permissions view* as a super admin. Here you may search for an existing user based on name or username and change their role to customer, admin, or super admin. You may also delete User accounts (note that deleted accounts _may not be recovered_)

![Permissions](documentation/images/User_Permissions_change_view.png)
> Screenshot of the admin user permissions page. On this page super admins can change the status of any user to a regular customer, admin, or super admin, as well as delete users completely.

## Technical details

### Project Dependencies
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-clii#download-and-install)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for automated tests
<!-- I need to figure out protractor webdriver with Selenium ~ ~ -->

### Development
- Clone or Download
- Connect to Heroku
    + Run `heroku login` to authenticate into your Heroku account.
    + Connect to a app: `heroku git:remote -a [heroku app name]`
        * Gulp will **NOT** work if you don't do this (and by extension **NOTHING WILL**). There are ways around this once you acquire the environmental variables
    + For project duplication: You **MUST** be added as a collaborator on the project, and have specific config variables defined in order for this to work. These variables are referred in the backend code as `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`, and they are:
        * Database: MONGODB_URI
        * Emailing:
            - Yahoo: YAHOO_USERNAME and YAHOO_PASSWORD (not real password, see instructions)
            - Gmail: GMAIL_USERNAME, GMAIL_PASSWORD (**real password**) and CLIENT_ID. I'd recommend to at least b64-encode your password since you will have to store it in plain text (`atob` and `btoa` node packages do this in the backend for you).
            - Instructions how to obtain these can be found [here](#somewhere)
            <!-- Marcial: TODO soon -->
- Installation and Execution
  + First run: `npm run first-install`
      * Make sure **NOT** to have the project tree open in an IDE/Text Edition (e.g. [Sublime Text 3](sublimetext.com), or any of other crappier alternative kids use these days). If issues persist after closing it try to run the command with admin privileges
  + Any other time: `gulp`. [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) provides automatic server and front-end restarts after local file changes
      * For a cleaner command line, it helps if you add the clearing command of your OS first (`cls` on Windows, `clear` on Unix), then command separator (`;` or `&&`), and THEN `gulp`
- Deployments
  + Automatically on every push to master if you have set up automatic deployment in Heroku:
  + [Instructions](https://youtu.be/_tiecDrW6yY?t=179)
    *  TL;DW: Heroku â†’ App â†’ Deploy tab â†’ On 'Deployment method' select 'GitHub' â†’ Connect to GiHub â†’ Search your repo â†’ 'Connect' â†’ 'Automatic deploys' â†’ 'Enable automatic deploys'
  + Manually once connected with Heroku's git: 
    * `git push heroku master`
- Testing
    + First time: `npm run first-tests`
    + Later: `npm run tests`


### Borrowed Code
- Boilerplate project was based off a modified [Assignment 5](https://github.com/CEN3031-spr16/Assignment-5).
- Most static dependencies are listed in *package.json*, and downloaded in *client/fonts* and *client/dependencies*.
- Styling templates: Bootstrap, and the [Lumino](https://medialoot.com/item/lumino-admin-bootstrap-template/) template.
- *md5-device-fingerprint.js*: File used to calculate a browser-specific MD5 hash, [source](https://gist.github.com/splosch/eaacc83f245372ae98fe)
- Other code sections were borrowed from StackOverflow, and used throughout our app. A their source was provided in a comment if so.


### Overall comments & Implementation tweaks
- TBFuther explained
- *Main parts of the app (Factory monolith, Express)*
- *EJS and path passing*
- *Authentication description*
- Custom Frontend:
  - *non-obvious parts*

<!-- 
  @Max: check if you can put this somewhere else in the app functionality. Gotta AT LEAST STRESS Material design somewhere.
  - Checkbox to search query functionality
  - Material design floating (& hidden) menu button(s)
  - Selection/checkbox for mass data manipulation (mass update, delete, archive, etc.)
  - Material design inputs and drop down selectors
